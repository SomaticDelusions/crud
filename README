Purpose:
Write a menu driven program that will 
  view all people
  add, delete, update a person (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  view all people that begin with a user provided letter (case-insensitive)
  view youngest and oldest person
  view all people younger than 21
  A person is represented by a name and an age. Use parallel arrays to manage a list of names and their ages.  
    For example, 
      names = [“tom”,”dick”,”harry”]
      ages = [35,53,23]
    The values at each index are related to each other so if you perform CRUD actions to one you have to do perform it also on the other.  
      ie. names[0] is related to ages[0].  names[0] 's age is 35.

Initialize program with the 2 hard coded arrays above for names and ages so that you have some starting data

When printing list people, make the reports list both the name and the age for each record, like:
  Tom	  35
  Dick	  53
  Harry	  23

Make menu like:

1. View all people
2. Add a new person
3. Update an existing person
4. Delete a person

5. View all people that start with a letter
6. View all people younger than 21
7. View Oldest Person
8. View Youngest Person

9. Quit
